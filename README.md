# XRD_denoising
X-ray diffraction denoising using deep convolutional neural networks.

This repository contains Python source code for denoising experimental low-counting statistics X-ray diffraction data. It provides the neural-network definitions as well as a training pipeline. It doesn't contain the code for data pre-processing.
